Mobile Price Classification is a dataset used for predictive modeling and machine learning tasks, specifically to predict the price range of mobile devices based on their features.

The dataset typically includes attributes such as:

- RAM
- Storage
- Battery capacity
- Display size
- Resolution
- Processor speed
- Number of cameras
- Operating System

The goal is to classify mobile devices into price ranges (e.g., low, mid, high) based on these features.
